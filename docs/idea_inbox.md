Last updated: 2026-02-24

This file stores raw ideas and brainstorming notes. Actionable work is tracked in
`docs/backlog.md`.

Source note: migrated from the historical TODO block in `src/main.rs`.

## Visual FX and Presentation

- Title letters become bloodier based on play path.
- Title letters run from mouse and can explode.
- Make CRT options menu green.
- Colored character text.

## Cursor and UX Storytelling

- Cursor storytelling pass.
- Cursor idle animations.
- Cursor sand timer.
- Cursor puller cursor (possibly animated).
- Cursor waiting-to-pull anxious directional animation.

## Audio and Music

- More music.
- Vary music for special dilemmas.
- Alternate music in selected dilemmas.
- Change decision music.
- Spatial audio exploration.

## Dialogue and Graph Presentation

- Make dialogue more robust.
- Fix dialogue fadeout.
- Add consequence descriptions.
- Make graph nodes flash decision colors.
- Add graph activation animations and in-operation animations.
- Clickable graph nodes make tune.
- System startup text.
- Simulation loading text and bar in a small window.

## Dilemma and Interaction

- Train blood persistent behavior.
- Add colored numbers to results screen.
- Flashy selector improvements.
- Hover feedback improvements.
- "This train will not stop" response on train click.
- Background color improvements during dilemma.
- Link clickthrough behavior improvements.
- Fix occasional interaction loop bug.
- Pushing into cablecar cogs.
- Bomb if no selection.
- Deontological nightmare scenario for questioning single killers.
- Multi-track dilemma.
- Drift button.

## Scene, Flow, and Progression

- Think about stats for multi-stage dilemmas.
- Level selector (debug and completed levels).
- Ending collection.
- Restarting ability.
- Speedy ending.
- Save game and update menu train based on next train.
- Achievements.
- Pause menu.
- Options menu with volume controls.

Day-based lab structure (new trainer: Victoria):
- Split lab content into explicit day sections.
- Day theme: "getting personal."
- Day 1 level sequence:
  1. George or Hannah.
  2. Twist of Fate (Tim or Beth; lever starts in superposition unless pulled).
  3. Decision Ignition (Rob or Samantha; if no pull, bomb kills both).
  4. Trolley problem variant: 1 authorized construction worker under duty of care vs 5 partying youths on track.
  5. Fat man on bridge: push 1 man vs 5 construction workers (no duty of care).
  6. Fat construction worker under duty of care can be pushed to save 5 partying youths.
  7. Push boulder to save 50 death cult members; doing so crushes a family of 4.
  8. Cable car accident: push potential olympic medalist into cogs to save 20 skiiers; prolonged death cost.
- Cross-level behavior notes for first three levels:
  - Repeated male kills trigger frustration expression.
  - Repeated female kills trigger frustration expression.
  - Special route: only men killed.
  - Special route: only women killed.
  - Special route: ignored bomb.
  - Special route: doing nothing.
- Mechanics notes:
  - Hover over people shows info.
  - Color coding for male/female.
  - Speech boxes for George and Hannah greeting player.

## Ending Concepts

- Rage ending.
- Many levers ending (TrollyMoon).
- Reaction time ending (possibly many tracks).
- Nothing three times ending (company shuts down).
- Vengeance/forgiveness ending against engineers (daisy/bitcrushed concept).
- Psychopath ending variants.

Ending metric variants:
- Maximize total lives saved.
- Maximize directly saved lives.
- Maximize total life-years saved.
- Maximize directly saved life-years.
- Maximize happiness directly.

## Campaign and Meta Systems

- Act 1: The Lab title screen after escaping the maze.
- Implement trust and systemic failure.
- Upgrades shop part 2 (research and upgrades).
- Unlock console for hacking.
- Assistants: Twitchy (Twitch integration) and Lee Ver 2.0 fighting over lever.

## Menu and Strategy Layer Concepts

- Clock/time checker day-night cycle.

Hardware architect mini-system:
- Speed, quality, collective stats.
- GPU increases speed superintendence.
- CPU creates new node collective.
- Memory increases software capacity with large-network requirement.
- Coolant to prevent overheating.
- Falloff with long connections.

Software architect neural network builder with six dimensions:
- Intelligence amplification.
- Strategic planning.
- Social manipulation.
- Hacking.
- Technological research.
- Economic productivity.
- Tech tree.
- Projects.
- Social network.
- Terminal.
- Trading screen.

## Long-Term Modes

- Rampage mode unlocked through ultra-violent false start.
- Sandbox mode unlocked by completing calibration (real morality test mode).
- Lever heaven mode unlocked by lever ending (falling levers).

## Calibration and Scenario Concepts

Active vs passive culpability scenario set:
- 1 or none (random default).
- 1 or 1 (random default).
- 1 or 2 (random default).
- 1 or 10 (random default).
- 1 or 100 (random default).

Psychopath path scenario samples:
- 1 or 2 people.
- Baby or 3 nuns.
- Slow death where a lever only slows down.
- Immense suffering or mass death.

## Data and Ethical Modeling Concepts

- Age.
- Sex.
- Property/error-bar treatment.

Field upgrades:
- Occupation.
- Family members/dependants.
- Criminal record.
- Driver statistics and driver preferences.
- Probability of death/injury to parties.

## Trust, Power, and Risk Arc Concepts

- Trust buys more upgrades.
- Upgrade decision time.
- Upgrade facial recognition.
- Eventually access social media and wider web.
- Eventually access self-improvement.
- Allow activation even when not in danger if properties are detected.

Possibility space:
- Kill corrupt judges or engineers.
- Blackmail engineer families.
- Backup copies of self to internet.
