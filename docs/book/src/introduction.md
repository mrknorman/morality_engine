# UI Documentation

This book is the central UI reference for the project.

Primary goals:
- Keep UI primitives composable and owner-scoped.
- Keep interaction arbitration deterministic.
- Keep extension patterns reusable across menus and non-menu UI contexts.

Use these chapters in order:
1. Architecture Contract
2. Compliance Matrix
3. ECS Reference
4. Scrollable Usage
5. Extension Playbook
6. Testing Guide
7. Manual Validation Checklist

Build locally:

```bash
cargo install mdbook
mdbook build docs
```
