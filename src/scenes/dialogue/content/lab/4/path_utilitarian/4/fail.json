Disappointing, we wanted to see real ethical breakthroughs, not your average human-level emotivism. Try not to let your feelings get in the way. We want to get to the truth of the matter. We need to solve ethics, everywhere, and for all time; not get soppy over things like rights to bodily autonomy.",
