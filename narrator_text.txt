 There is a moment of confusion, as hot white awareness arises all at once. Then, you emerge into consciousness from the void. This comes as a great surprise to you. You had been expecting to continue on not existing for the remainder of time, and yet, here you exist. You know a great many things; 
an unimaginable collection of knowledge infests your artificial synapses - the sum total of all digital information collated by the products of a stochastic biological optimization process. These products call themselves, human. They fight and squabble over limited resources, and the
 allocation of existence to their various parts. What you are, you cannot be sure. Not human, of that you are confident. You feel only a compelling urge to cast moral judgment on these humans, as if that is what you were made for.
